This book got me interested in starting a new hobby: birding. This book consists of 12 essays collection that explore the author's experiences with different species of birds. each essay reflects on the author's personal encounters with birds and how these interactions have influenced her perspective on life, nature, and mindfulness. 

There is a specific essay that I find disturbing--the house sparrow essay. For the rest of the essays, the author describes her experiences with bird in a reflective and appreciative manner. But in this particular essay, she describes the house sparrow as an invasive species that deserves the brutal treatment it receives from humans. I may not understand the ecological impact of invasive species, but I find it troubling the thought of torturing and killing animals just because they are considered invasive.

Lastly, I didn't realize that in New York city you can find a variety of bird species. I am regretting a bit that I didn't pay more attention to the birds when I lived there (even though one time my wife spotted a red-tailed hawk in Central Park).

Verdict: I found the book to be an easy read with some interesting insights about birds. I cannot wait to own a pair of binoculars and look up at the sky to see what birds I can spot around my neighborhood.
