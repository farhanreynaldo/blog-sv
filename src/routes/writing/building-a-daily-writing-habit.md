Yesterday marked 1-month of my daily journaling habit (to be frank, I missed a few days, but it’s still a win). I started this out of frustration with my writing. It’s a vital part of my personal and professional life, and it irks me to compare my work to others who seem to write beautifully without effort.

I don't aim for a poetic, pretentious, or extravagant style; I just want to write clearly and efficiently. Maybe I’ll learn to be poetic every once in a while, but that’s not the priority. So, fingers crossed for another month of daily journaling.
