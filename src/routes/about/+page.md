Hi, I’m Aldo! I started this digital garden out of frustration with most social media’s single-format boxes. I wanted a place where a long-form essay could live alongside my photographs, where projects I developed could sit next to film and book reviews. This is that place: my own corner of the internet, where I control the narrative and the format. Feel free to wander through the various facets of my life, fellow stranger!
