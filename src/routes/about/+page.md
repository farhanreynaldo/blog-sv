Hi, I am Aldo! I'm currently working as a data science consultant at the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/), where I work as part of a [Data Development Partnership](https://datapartnership.org/). I completed my Master's degree in Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences at [Columbia University in the City of New York](https://www.columbia.edu/).

Previously I worked as a senior data analyst at Tokopedia and as a data scientist at Delman Data Lab and Dattabot. I earned my bachelor's degree from Institut Teknologi Bandung majoring in bioengineering.

My interests lie in Bayesian data analysis, experimentation, and causal inference. Here's my latest [resume](https://weaklyinformative.com/pdf/cv.pdf).
