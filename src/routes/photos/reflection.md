This photo was taken a few days after I repaired my TTArtisan pancake lens. It captures Rafida's figure using the reflection on a metal tabletop as the medium. 

I picked up my camera again after being inspired by the cinematography in Better Call Saul, which led me to start documenting everyday moments from more unusual perspectives.
