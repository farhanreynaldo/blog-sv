### Hi, I'm Aldo 👋

I am currently working as a data science consultant at the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/), where I work as part of a
[Data Development Partnership](https://datapartnership.org/). I completed my Master's degree in Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences at [Columbia University in the City of New York](https://www.columbia.edu/). My interest lies in the field of bayesian data analysis, experimentation, and causal inference. Nice to e-meet you!
